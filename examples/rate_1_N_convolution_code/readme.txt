This is a MATLAB version of a 1/n convolution code scheme.  It can be interchangeable with other rates as well as several different memory elements.  To find out how to change the code to your needs, please see my writeup (.pdf).  You can also find a copy on my website.

Instructions:
1) Open MATLAB, set the appropriate directory
2) Run the test file:  runme.m
3) Change simulation parameters, rate, and memory elements as needed

ENJOY!
